## How it works
You can refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend/wiki) to understand how different Fluxend components work and how they can be integrated into your existing stack. These explain basic functionality and detailed inner workings backed by flowcharts. Some of the topics include:
- [Dynamic REST endpoints](https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend/wiki/Dynamic-REST-Endpoints)
- [Authentication](https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend/wiki/Authentication)
- [Forms](https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend/wiki/Forms)
- [Storage](https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend/wiki/Storage)
- [Backup](https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend/wiki/Backups).

## Installation

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended for Easy Setup)
To get up and running with Fluxend in just a few minutes, simply follow these steps:

Clone the Fluxend repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluxend/fluxend.git fluxend
cd fluxend
make setup
   ```
This might take a while during first run. This will start two Docker containers:

- **Database Container**: A Postgres database to store your data.
- **Fluxend Server**: A backend server running on port 80.

Once the server is up, you can access the API documentation at http://localhost/docs/index.html.

### Method 2: Standalone Binary (For Self-Contained Deployments)
Prefer a single binary to run without Docker? You can easily build Fluxend and run it as a standalone executable:

Build with `make build` and then `./bin/fluxend` to start the server.

## Commands
Fluxend has several commands to perform operations and make your experience smoother. Fluxend binary supports core commands which is further augmented by make commands
