## Flowcharts
You can refer to the `.flowcharts` directory to understand how Fluxton works and how it can be integrated into your existing stack. These provide insights into dynamic REST endpoints, authentication, forms, storage, and backup processes.

## Installation

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended for Easy Setup)
To get up and running with Fluxton in just a few minutes, simply follow these steps:

Clone the Fluxton repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluxton-io/fluxton.git fluxton
cd fluxton
make setup
   ```
This might take a while during first run. This will start two Docker containers:

- **Database Container**: A Postgres database to store your data.
- **Fluxton Server**: A backend server running on port 80.

Once the server is up, you can access the API documentation at http://localhost/docs/index.html.

### Method 2: Standalone Binary (For Self-Contained Deployments)
Prefer a single binary to run without Docker? You can easily build Fluxton and run it as a standalone executable:

Build with `make build` and then `./bin/fluxton` to start the server.

## Commands
Fluxton has several commands to perform operations and make your experience smoother. Fluxton binary supports core commands which is further augmented by make commands
